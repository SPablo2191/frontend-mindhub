        <h3>SPORTSMANSHIP</h3>
        <p>
          The common interest that members of the Association share is to
          inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play.
          Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee
          whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary
          action regardless of technical hockey background, expertise,
          accomplishments or standing.

        <ol class="regulations">
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>DIMENSIONS.</b> IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field
              dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and length.
              These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams
              under 12 and older.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>COMPETITION FIELDS.</b> Fields used within the competition program
              must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or
              associations participating in the state competition program that
              are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum
              requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
              assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to
              the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should
              be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are
              unable to provide an acceptable field may be required to play all
              their games away.
